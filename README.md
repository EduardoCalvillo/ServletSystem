# ServletSystem
This is the latest version of ChatSystem, that implements a centralized architecture using a server to manage the network notifications.

However, we as a team consider this version is not what was asked for. We ask you to refer to our previous version [Version 1.02](https://www.github.com/Kuro10/ChatSystem.git) for our better system.


ServletSystem, also known as ChatSystem V1.02, uses the same system but changes it's internal structure to allow a centralization, this has as a consequence 2 things:
  1.- There a severe reduction on the number of broadcast messages sent through the network.
  2.- Almost all communication is dependant on the server's well-being, so if the server crashes, the system cannot operate functionally.

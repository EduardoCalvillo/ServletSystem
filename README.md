# ServletSystem
This is the latest version of ChatSystem, that implements a centralized architecture using a server to manage the network notifications.

However, we as a team consider this version is not what was asked for. We ask you to refer to our previous version [Version 1.02](https://www.github.com/Kuro10/ChatSystem.git) for our better system.
